<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><i>This simple expense tracker application was created to help me further understand the principles of Javascript and DOM manipulation. The app allows the user to input their expenses to a table and delete specific rows as needed. I've also incorporated some local storage functionality so that the expense tracker holds the values when the browser window is re-loaded. Feel free to open the application to create your very own expense list!</i></p>
