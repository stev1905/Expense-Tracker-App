<i>Expense tracker app is written in Vanillas Javascript, HTML & CSS</i>



<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><i>I had alot of fun creating this game. It's written in HTML, CSS & Vanilla Javascript. I tried to experiment and add some cool css effects. To start, the user must select either rock, paper or scissors on the top row. Once clicked, there is a event listener that will fire and handle the logic of playing against the computer and determining the winner. Check it out and good luck beating the computer!</i></p>
