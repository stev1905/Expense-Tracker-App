<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><i>This simple expense tracker was created to help me further understand Javascript and DOM manipulation. I incorporated some local storage functionality so that the expense tracker hold it's values when the browser window is reloaded. Feel free to open the app create your very own expense list.</i></p>
